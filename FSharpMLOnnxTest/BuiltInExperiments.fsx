(*
    Experiments for replacing method calls to built in functions with the quotation equivilant
    I don't have a prefered method at this stage. This is not being used at this stage as it's fine
    to run the with Call for the purposes of building a ONNX Graph

// TODO replace built in operators with 
// NOTE: This is not needed as we can execute built-ins during graph construction

// NOTES On generic type substitution on Expressions
// Functions that use generics have a type of the name of the generic, these are knowable ahead of time
// In theory it should be possible to substitute the variable assignments with variables of the replaced types
// It would have to thread through structual typeing, and perhaps even NewObject
// It could go a long way
